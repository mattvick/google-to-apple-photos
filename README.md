# How to export Google Photos and import into Apple Photos

## Export from Google Photos via Takeout

Typically I create multiple exports, one for each year, and select 50GB as the download size. This way the exports are more sanely organised, and also [GooglePhotosTakeoutHelper](https://github.com/TheLastGimbus/GooglePhotosTakeoutHelper) requires these albums.

1. Go to Google Takeout - https://takeout.google.com/settings/takeout
1. Deselect all
1. Select just Google Photos
1. Select the album for the year you want to export - _albums named "Photos from 2014" etc. are auto generated by Google_
1. Wait for an email notification from Google that the archive is ready to download
1. Download the archive

## Import into the Apple Photos app

1. Extract the archive
1. Use https://github.com/TheLastGimbus/GooglePhotosTakeoutHelper to fix the photo dates
1. Import the fixed files into the Apple Photos app
